## Introduction & Background 
(An introduction that motivates & outlines a clear, specific set of research questions. Also, provide some background on your topic)

Everyone enjoys watching movies! Don't know what to watch next? Use our app, InfinityWatch, where we will supply you with recommendations and movie analytics! Want to explore a huge dataset of movies? Explore our visualizations using InfinityWatch!

Our team felt that making a web app using Shiny was the one of most useful applications from this course. We envisioned a Movie Recommender App that has multiple tabs which also provides Movie recommendations while also providing data visualizations of the dataset. 

## Data 
(Specification of your data sources and collection process.)

The Movie Recommender App is built upon a movie dataset with 9000+ movies. This is a publicly accessible dataset and was retrieved from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/disham993/9000-movies-dataset). 

Features of the dataset:
- Release_Date: Date when the movie was released.
- Title: Name of the movie.
- Overview: Brief summary of the movie.
- Popularity: It is a very important metric computed by TMDB developers based on the number of views per day, votes per day, number of users marked it as "favorite" and "watchlist" for the data, release date and more other metrics.
- Vote_Count: Total votes received from the viewers.
- Vote_Average: Average rating based on vote count and the number of viewers out of 10.
- Original_Language: Original language of the movies. Dubbed version is not considered to be original language.
- Genre: Categories the movie it can be classified as.
- Poster_Url: Url of the movie poster.
